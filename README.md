# rockchip-boot_merger
static blob for latest boot_merger

Received from Rockchip. This appears to be the latest version of the boot_merger found here:
https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rkbin (tools/boot_merger)

The version on the above github appears to be compiled Python (and dynamically linked) while this seems to be C and statically linked but I'm not sure
